		<h3>My personall story</h3>
		  
		<!-- write a nice essay with pic and everything i learned -->
		  
		<p>&emsp;Moving to a whole different country is very difficult, but my direction is toward the future. I was a happy kid growing up in Israel, not worrying about the future until my family and I relocated to the United States to a new place where we were unfamiliar with the language. This transition in my life changed everything. It was so difficult for me that it changed my personality, but through this life experience, I learned that hardship can bring you to a higher place.</p>
		  
	    <p>&emsp;I was 11 years old when my family and I moved to the US. When I was younger, I imagined how fun and amazing it would be to move to the US. I remember being really excited to experience new things as a child, like getting a new car and home, as well as flying on an airplane. This excitement <strong>faded quickly </strong> after we moved. Because I was a shy kid and didn't speak English, it was really difficult for me to communicate and make friends in school. I had to make it through the day at school without understanding or speaking a word. As a result, I felt lonely at school without any friends to talk to, <em>like a wolf left out of the pack.</em> Going home at the end of the day was my favorite part of school.</p>
		  
		<p>&emsp;After two years in school without an English tutor, I had to learn English <strong>on my own.</strong> Later on, I went to high school. I wanted to improve my social skills but was unable to do so out of fear that people would make fun of my English. I stayed in my comfort zone for the following two years, feeling alone and afraid. But I felt the need to break out of my comfort zone and change my life because I knew it couldn't continue this way. I started seeing a therapist last year, and he helped me break out of my comfort zone and gain confidence.</p>
		  
		<p>&emsp;After leaving my home country, <em>I felt uprooted from my <strong>source</strong></em> and had to start a new life in a completely new place without the tools to survive. Even when I failed and gave up, I was always supported and encouraged to keep going by my <strong>mother.</strong> She reassured me and showed me the best of myself over the years. She helped me settle into a new country, learn a second language at the age of 11, and develop the confidence to engage in conversations with people. Over those difficult years in my life, I learned a lot. Just by relocating to America, I acquired new life skills and learned a new language. Now, I see everything from a different perspective. I accomplished so much and overcame so many challenges that I believe it has changed who I am and who I could be in the future.</p>
		  
		<p>&emsp;Through this life experience, I learned that hardship can bring you to a <strong>higher place.</strong> Moving to the United States was a major change in my life that influenced me to always push myself even in difficult times because I know that one day I will be in a better place. I never give up, even if it takes a long time. Life has taught me to never quit, even if it is extremely hard. When you overcome big challenges in your life, you become stronger than before.</p>
